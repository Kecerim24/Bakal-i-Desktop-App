# Bakalari-Desktop-App

An unnamed (for now) desktop app meant to be used with Bakaláři, a ubiquitous Czech grading system.

It is written in Godot Engine. Why? Because we felt like it.

## Features
- This thing is like one day old. What are you expecting?

## License
- We'll decide on that later, I guess.
